### How to use the index files for the experiments ?

The index files are named like "session_x.txt", where x indicates the session number. Each index file stores the indexes of the images that are selected for the session.

"session_1.txt" stores all the base class training images. Each "session_t.txt" (t>1) stores the 25 (5 classes and 5 shots per class) few-shot new class training images.
